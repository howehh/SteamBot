# SteamSpammer
A bot to automate spamming a steam friend

This program will log onto your steam account and spam a desired user with messages from a given pastebin. These messages can be image links (preferably hosted on gyazo as they are confirmed to show up in messages).

# Use responsibly, this is intended to ward off annoying friends who won't stop messaging you

1. Install node.js
2. Edit config.json with steam account name, password, the pastebin containing all the messages, and the steam ID of the user to spam
3. Run the bot with `node index.js`

To update the bot with more messages, update the pastebin and restart bot.
